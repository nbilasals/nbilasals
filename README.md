### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate Informatics Engineering student.

I'm quite passionate in using _data_ and _AI_ to practical issues. I'm really excited about using technology to positively impact people's lives. I've worked on some projects that have given me experience in **data analysis** and **machine learning**.
