### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Nabilla** is an undergraduate Informatics Engineering student at Universitas Halu Oleo. 

I'm quite passionate in using _data_ and _AI_ to practical issues. I love the idea of leveraging technology to make a difference in people's lives. I've worked on some projects that have given me experience in **data analysis** and **machine learning**.
